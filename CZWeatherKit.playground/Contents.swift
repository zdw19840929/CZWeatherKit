# Using a Weather Service
This is an example showing how to use a weather service. As you can see it's
pretty similar to CZWeatherRequest's API however a service can be configured
with a cache, allows for user configuration of the NSURLSession it's using, and
can manage your API key if you're calling an API that requires one. For 
simplicity, this example doesn't get into all that but feel free to experiment
with those features in this playground.
